# Everhope Landing Page - Take Home Assignment

This is the landing page for Everhope that I recreated as my take home assignment.

## üìù Development Notes

### Time Constraints

- **Limited to weekend/evening development** due to day job commitments
- **Prioritized core functionality** over pixel-perfect design details
- **Focused on responsive behavior** and component reusability
- There is an issue in the navigation menu, the placement of sub navigation menu. Kept to fix at the end.

### Design Decisions

- **Chose flexibility over exact matching** to create reusable components
- **Implemented mobile-first approach** for better responsive experience
- **Used Tailwind utilities** for rapid development and consistency

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript throughout** for better development experience
- **Component composition** for maintainability
- **Consistent naming conventions** and file structure

## üìö Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with shadcn/ui integration
- **Icons**: Heroicons \& custom SVGs
- **Images**: Next.js Image component

**Note**: This project represents a best-effort implementation within limited time constraints. While striving for design accuracy, priority was given to functionality, responsiveness, and code quality over pixel-perfect visual matching.
